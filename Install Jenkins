3.	Check you have set the variable correctly by opening up command prompt (run + cmd) and typing mvn -version. 
The output should show your Maven version.

Case: "Fixing “mvn not recognized as an internal or external command” error"
Part 1: set up in Path env
M2_HOME: This is supposed to be a user variable that points towards your Maven directory.
M2: This is an environment variable that points towards Maven’s bin folder. Example: $M2_HOME/bin
Part 2: Set up on jenkins browser
Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration -> Maven: set up name and MAVEN_HOME:[PATH]

Linux_Windows in README.txt:

 Installing Maven
  ----------------

  1) Unpack the archive where you would like to store the binaries, e.g.:

    Unix-based operating systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X)
      tar zxvf apache-maven-3.x.y.tar.gz
    Windows
      unzip apache-maven-3.x.y.zip

  2) A directory called "apache-maven-3.x.y" will be created.

  3) Add the bin directory to your PATH, e.g.:

    Unix-based operating systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X)
      export PATH=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.x.y/bin:$PATH
    Windows
      set PATH="c:\program files\apache-maven-3.x.y\bin";%PATH%

  4) Make sure JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your JDK

  5) Run "mvn --version" to verify that it is correctly installed.



-----------------------set up master slave MODE---------------------------------------
Set up Master&Slave:
case 1: Window & Linux (Master - slave)
Manage Jenkins -> Manage nodes -> New Node
+ Step 1: 
-"Node name" ten cua node slave
-stick "Permanent agent"
-Configure Global Security > stick "TCP port for inbound agents - Random"
OR
Manage Jenkins => Configure Global Security => Enable security 
=> TCP port for JNLP agents Set it to either Fixed (for this option also set the port number) or Random.

+ Step 2: 
-Name:ten cua may slave
-of executors: so luong core xu ly task
-remote root directory: ten thu muc lam viec tren may chu Slave
-Launch method: via SSH or Java web.
----->Host: IP of slave host
----->Credentials: Add Jenkins --> user and password of an account on slave host
----->Host Key Verification Strategy: Non verifying.......
-Node Properties:
----->Tool Location: set up tool lien quan nhu Maven,git,etc....
=> SAVE and check


case 2: Linux & Window (Master - slave)



case 3: Window (Master - slave)
manage plugin --> Install plugins: "Slave SetupPlugin"
Launch method: Launch agent by connecting it as the master


---> Qua Slave host: access browser and use method #1: "Launch agent from browser on slave"
